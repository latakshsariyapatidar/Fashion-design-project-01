## First Website: Inspired by Pinterest! âœ¨
This repository holds the code for my very first website!   I drew inspiration from a fantastic design I found on Pinterest (big thanks to the original creator!), and I'm  trying to incorporate some responsive elements to make it shine on any device.   (Although, let's be honest, it's still a work in progress. )

## What's in here?

All the code that makes this website tick! (HTML and CSS )
Let me know what you think!

I'm still learning the ropes, so any feedback or suggestions are more than welcome!  Feel free to tinker around and let me know if you find any bugs.  Happy browsing!
